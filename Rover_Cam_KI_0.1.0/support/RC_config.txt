-   ---- Rover Cam KI Config ----


- Rover Cam is designed to run without an internet connection, if accurate date stamps
- are desired, the time will have to be set for each time the program starts.
- Note: Will lose accuracy over long periods of time. Does not compensate for leap years, or
- day light savings.
- Aim for the time that the pi will be booted, plus about 1 minute, for boot and program start.
- The format is 24 hour time in this order: year, month, day, hour, minute, second.
set_time = 1000 01 01 01 01 01

run_at_system_boot = N

- When motion is detected, how long should video be recorded for?
- If set to 3 or less seconds, then images will be saved instead. If set to 0 every motion 
- frame will be saved. If set to 0.5 then one motion frame per half second will be saved,
- while motion is detected.
clip_time = 0.5

- To use a UBS camera leave this setting off
use_pi_camera = N

- Camera software may adjust this to one of it's nearest capability. Default 640x480.
resolution = 640x480

- Set the max frames per second. This is limited by processing power so actual FPS maybe
- lower. If clips are playing fast with shorter clip times then set "Clip Time", try a lower FPS.
fps = 15

- Motion area size: a lower number here may cause false detections.
- A higher number will only detect larger moving objects, or closer small objects.
- Recommended 65 or higher, default 130.								
motion_area = 130

- Motion sensitivity baseline: a lower number here will increase sensitivity.
- Is simular to motion area, but is effected more by brightly lite environments.
- If false detections are a problem, then motion area should be experimented with first.
- 4 is a good number here
motion_sens = 4

- mode 1 just records on motion
- mode 2 records and preforms actions on motion
- mode 3 just preforms actions on motion
mode = 1

- A numerical code, of any length, used access menu.
pin = 123

- Number the failed PIN attempts before key input will be locked for failed_pin_lock_time
allowable_pin_attempts = 3

- Time to lock any key input after a failed PIN attempt, in seconds. Enter "inf" to lock until pi, or program is
- restarted.
failed_pin_lock_time = 30

- Optionally play an audio or python3 files on motion
- Will play any and all .wav or .py files in "audio" folder, one after another in alphabetical order.
- (can be left on, will not fault out even if no files in location).
play_audio = N

- Delay Audio will delay the running of files, in the audio folder. A correct PIN entry in this time
- frame will cancel the audio.
delay_audio = 0

- Activation delay will add a time delay from boot up, and disabled state.
- Is useful if operator is physically inside the camera view, while using key inputs,
- or will pass through the camera view when leaving the area. (in seconds)
start_delay = 0

- Setting camera index to -1 is recommended, since the camera indexes on
- the pi could change. -1 will find any camera attached by lowest index number.
camera_index = -1


- Select Area Of Interest (AOI). Click the "Select/Add To AOI" button to set.
- Another window will pop-up where you can click and drag. A green rectangle will indicate the
- area that will be the AOI. Have a camera plugged in with the proper index setting. If an AOI is
- set then only motion that is detected inside the AOI, will trigger
- actions, clip recording, or audio. To remove the AOI effect, just clear, and save.
- Will only work properly on 4:3 resolution ratios, otherwise AOI boxes will be warped.

- Draw AOIs on saved clips and images.
draw_aoi = Y


- PiCamera spacific settings. May have different effects depending on type and version of pi camera used.
- See PiCamera documentation.

exposure_mode = default
sensor_mode = default
awb_mode = default
brightness = default
contrast = default
iso = default
shutter_speed = default



- Here you can write your custom program that turns GPIO pins on and off.
- These are referred to as "Actions", each Action controls a separate pin.
- The number that comes after "on" or "off" is the time in seconds that it will remain in that state.
- Enter "on" or "off", followed by a number of seconds to remain in that state, repeat on a new line.
- Alternate state with each new line. Always start in "off" state, even if for zero seconds.
- A correct PIN entry will cancel all actions if entered within the first "off" time frame.
- Decimal numbers accepted. 


Actions: always start in off state, 0's and decimals acceptable.
